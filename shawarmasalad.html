    </p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup avocado oil</li>
        <li>2 medium lemons, juiced</li> 
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>>½ head romaine lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine avocado oil, lemon juice, garlic, pepper, cumin, paprika, kosher salt, turmeric, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl and whisk to combine. </li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs into a gallon-sized resealable bag and pour the marinade over. Rub the marinade into the chicken with clean hands, then press the air out of the bag, seal, and place in the refrigerator. Marinate for at least 3 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and place it onto a rimmed baking sheet. Pour any excess marinade over the chicken. </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set aside to cool slightly, then slice into 1/2-inch strips. </li>
        <li>Place tahini, olive oil, 1/4 cup water, lemon juice, salt, and pepper for dressing into a blender. Blend until emulsified, adding additional water as needed to reach desired consistency. </li>
        <li>Chop romaine and butter lettuces. Place in a large bowl and toss to combine with parsley and mint. Layer tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion over the herb salad base. Top with chicken and drizzle with dressing to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
